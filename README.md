# Search-Based Rule Mining (SBRM) Implementation

Search-Based Rule Mining (SBRM) is an approach that combines multi-objective search algorithms with machine learning algorithms to mine the cross product line (CPL) rules for interacting products within/accross the product lines.Such rules constraint the configuraitons (Antecedents) of interacting products while indicating the corresponding system states (Consequents).

Dependencies:
1- Java 8
2- Apache Maven
3- jMetal Framework (A framework implementing multi-objectives search algorithms )
4- Weka Tool API 3.7.5 (An API implementing several machine learning algorithms)
5- Apache POI (API for reading/writing excel files)
6- Apache Common IO (API for manipulating files)
